A simple demo application that simulates a holiday booking website (for
city breaks) and shows the results on a web page. This demonstrates
severeal features of OpenShift Container Platform.

== What do I need to deploy this demo?

You simply need a working OpenShift environment! You can showcase Azure
specific functionality more easily if it is running on Azure.

= How to deploy this on OpenShift

== The frontend: public-shopping-website

=== Start a build of the public-shopping-website

In OpenShift Container Platform, you need to select *.NET Core* from the
service catalog. If you are running OpenShift Origin, you can import
this image builder into your service catalog by running oc create -f ...
against these files;
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/tree/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.7/image-streams

This should spawn the deployment wizard, click "Next >";

image:screenshots/dotnetDeploymentWizard1.png[image]

Complete the Wizard with the following details;

* *Add to Project:* Create Project
* *Project Name:* city-info
* *Project Display Name:* City Info
* *Project Description:* ...
* *Version:* 2.0 - The screenshot _above_ shows the OpenShift builder is
version 1.0, however, this builder has the option to use a compiler
which is different for .NET Core 1.0 or .NET Core 2.0 projects. The
version you are selecting in the screenshot _below_ is the *compiler
version*, and this is a .NET Core 2.0 project. Therefore it is very
important to select version 2 builder. If you use select version 1 here
by accident then it will expect a .NET Core 1.0 project.json files and
similar that have been deprecated and the build would fail!
* *Application Name:* city-info
* *Git Repository:*
https://github.com/jamesread/dotnetcore-city-info.git

Once the project has been created, it should see a build start in the
project overview;

You are now ready to try out one or more of the demo scenarios!

[[demo-scenarios]]
== Demo Scenarios

=== Deploying a feature branch for multivariate testing or A/B deployments 

* *Time to demo:* 5 minutes
* *Why is this cool?:* Feature branches are commonly used by developers
to develop new features that have not yet been integrated into the main
application. Product Managers might typically want to deploy a feature
branch to see how users accept this feature, to test it works as
expected, and gradually introduce it as users respond positively.

* Use the .NET Core Builder Image to deploy (the master branch) as
normal. This must be built with a v2.0 builder.

* Add to the project again, with a .NET Core Builder Image. This time,
use an *advanced options* to and specify the *feature_weather* branch.

image:screenshots/gitReference.png[image]

* Dot _not_ deploy a new route.

image:screenshots/noRoute.png[image]

* You should have something that looks like this;

image:screenshots/overview.png[image]

* Now go find the route, and edit it. You want to "Split traffic across
multiple services" and select the new feature branch.

image:screenshots/splitRoute.png[image]

Once saved, it should look something like this;

image:screenshots/splitRouteOverview.png[image]

* Now go view the application.

Press Ctrl + F5 to refresh the page. Half of the time, you'll get
weather icons, half of the time, you'll not get weather icons. Make sure
Cookies are disabled to disable session persistance.

=== Using envionment variables for Feature Toggles ----

* *Time to demo:* 5 minutes
* *Why is this cool?:* Showchasing how a modern application development
principle, "feature toggles", are simply and easily implemented with
containers.

This C# dotnet application will check for the environment
screenshotsiable SHOW_POPULATION as a means for enabling this feature in
responses to requests for city information. You should set this in the
DeploymentConfig, and watch OpenShift deploy a new version
automatically.

image:screenshots/editDcEnv.png[image]

Wait a moment while the application redeploys (necessary for environment
screenshotsiables to take effect).

You should see your city information pop up now with population numbers;

=== Configuring all pods to connect to a database 

* *Time to demo:* 5 minutes
* *Why is this cool?:* Showcases how microservice workloads absolutely
don't have to be stateless only, and how configuration is commonly
acheived with containers.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===============================================================
|Environment Vaiable |Example |Description
|DATABASE_USERNAME |SA |Your MsSQL Database Username
|DATABASE_PASSWORD |toomanysecrets |Your MsSQL Database Password
|===============================================================

The database schema can be found in /screenshots/databaseSchema.sql in
this Git repo.

The database name and the single table name are both hard-coded to
city-info.

=== Scaling a deployment

* *Time to demo:* 3
* *Why is this cool?:* To show how scaling is so super easy!

You can scale the city-info project at any time, just using the up/down
scale buttons. This will not impact existing connected users negatively.

image:screenshots/scalePods.png[image]

When you view the dashboard, you will see the city-info is provided with
a pod hostname. When you scale the application however, you will
probably see get updates from a single pod.

This is because OpenShift sets a browser cookie, which sticks you onto
one pod by default. You can easily overcome this, block the OpenShift
cookie in your browser like so;

=== Blue/Green deployments

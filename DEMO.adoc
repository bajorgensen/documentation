[NOTE]
This demo guide is intended for a reference and **prompt** for speakers who are showing this to an audience. These instructions are designed for people who know OpenShift and have run through the link:LAB.adoc[lab] several times before. It should not be used to learn how to use the project. For that, run through the more detailed link:LAB.adoc[lab instructions].
